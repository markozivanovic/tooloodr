### Creating a TooLooDR article

To create a TooLooDR article, we need to instantiate the TooLooDR class. To do this, we need to pass it the id of the div element in which our TooLooDR ready text resides. Here's an example.

```html
<div id="myArticle">
  <p>
    [tl1]This is the most important part of the article[tl2], followed by the less important part[/tl2].
    [tl3]Now I'm just giving some details that are for those who really want to know more.[/tl3][/tl1]
  </p>
</div>
```

```javascript
var myTooLooDR = new TooLooDR("#myArticle");
```
